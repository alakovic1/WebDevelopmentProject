# WebDev_project

> Website developed using HTML + CSS + JavaScript and Node.js + Ajax + MySQL with phpMyAdmin tool. For mapping a model I used object-relational mapping tool Sequelize. Galen framework was used to test layout testing. Mocha framework was used to test JavaScript. And Supertests were used to test server side (HTTP requests).
